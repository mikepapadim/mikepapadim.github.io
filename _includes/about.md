# About me


I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) with the [Advanced Processor Technologies ](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) (APT) Group. Currently my reseach focuses on  JIT compilation of Java programs for OpenCL compatible devices, and more specificaly on FPGAs. Also, I am interested in broad range of topics such as Parallel Programming, Hardware Accelerators, HPC, Compilers and Virtual Machines. My PhD is fully funded by the University  of Manchester.

Before joining the University of Manchester, I worked in Paris for Huawei Technologies research labs on modelling of HPC multicore architectures and scalability of tasks schedulus. Also, I completed my masters at TU Delft in the Netherlands where I completed my MSc thesis on OpenCL accelerators for computational finance models. My [thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A467fe2ad-db79-4d4a-9a4b-83e7c49d9106?collection=education) and the corresponding [publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-58943-5_16) are available online.
